# VitalSync-Plus-A-Health-Monitoring-System-Using-IoT-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
As the population keep on increasing, assessing individual health poses challenges due to constrained resources and the high cost of testing equipment. In response, 
we introduce VitalSync Plus, a solution integrating IoT and Machine Learning. This innovation streamlines health assessments. IoT facilitates remote health monitoring, 
capturing and analyzing real-time physiological data such as blood oxygen levels, heart rates, body temperatures, ECG signals, and CO2 gases. The system incorporates various sensors: 
ECG AD8232 for heart rate and arrhythmias detection, SPo2 for blood oxygen saturation measurement, MAX30102 for heart pulse monitoring, DS18B20 for temperature measurement, MQ-135 for Carbon Dioxide detection. 
Through Machine Learning, the system categorizes heart rate into five distinct patterns. Additionally, it generates comprehensive health reports, including Body Mass Index (BMI) and sends an SMS to the patient.

# Steps to Follow
1. Make the connections as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code.
3. Create a folder and save the framework files (e.g., .html, .css).
4. Create a XAMPP database as per the requirements shown.
5. Create a Twilio account.
6. Download the dataset for heart disease prediction (I am not providing the dataset because I used an IEEE dataset).
7. Run the 'training_model_new.py' file.
8. Then, run the 'app_new.py' file.
9. Open the home.html page in the browser and monitor the patient's health data.
